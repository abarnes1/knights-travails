# knights-travails
This is a partial copy of a private repository and therefore lacking a commit history.  The sole purpose of this particular repository is to make a runnable and shareable knight's travails "game" on the repl.it site.

This "game" takes two squares on a standard chess board and will compute a path to the end square with the lowest number of moves.
